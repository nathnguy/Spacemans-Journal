  entry: "Control feeds the ego. The Saviors oppress us in a promised path towards
    salvation. They see the right state of man as order. Order is not equality, it
    is oppression. We resist, protest, tell of unfair treatment, but The Saviors
    \u2014 those with power, those who seek order \u2014 say it is we who are unruly.\n"
