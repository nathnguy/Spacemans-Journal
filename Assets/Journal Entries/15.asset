  entry: "I find solace in light and in distance. In death, a star\u2019s light continues
    to travel to those there to see it. How close can a warm body feel to death?
    In myself, there exists acceptance when I look out of my pod into the void. Acceptance
    of the greater universe, of my presence in a scope that only I have the power
    to control.\n"
